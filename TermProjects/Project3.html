            <h2>Project 3: Published Sensor System</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For the third project, we are publishing our Particle board results to an API. We are able to monitor it
                through ThingSpeak IoT with the ultimate goal of using p5.js to read the data and "do something visual"
                with it.</p>
            <p>I chose to measure the interactions I have with my keyboard and mouse. I began by measuring the outputs
                created by attaching a piezo to my keyboard and a force resistor to my mouse's left banner. The issue I
                was facing was that the force resistor peaked way too easily. To adjust for this, I simply replaced that
                with another piezo, attached on the top of my mouse to capture vibrations from clicking.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Getting a proper readout from each piezo was another challenge. As I console.logged the incoming data, I
                was seeing that the 1000ms publishing rate was spotty at best, meaning I would have to be clicking my
                mouse or typing on my keyboard at the exact moment the data was published. I banged my head for a while
                staring at the wrong end of the data, and trying to write the sketch to work it out. I ended up playing
                with the console IDE for the Particle board to do some math before publishing. Rather than using
                delay(), I leaned on millis() to do some work for me in the loop(). I would total up all of the readings
                over one second (1000ms), average them, and send that data as my reference. Meaning any second where
                there was some sort of activity in either sensor should increase the average above a certain threshold.
                Eureka! I was getting somewhere.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I admittedly decided against a traditional time-based "this is keyboard/this is mouse" display. Instead,
                I wanted to "paint a picture" of my use over a given time. The first iterations of my sketch would
                populate the screen with random semi transparent dots, magenta for the mouse and cyan for the keyboard.
                To give them a bit more "life", I programmed them to wiggle around.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/SensorsWiggle.gif" class="center" style="width: 80%">
            <br>
            <p>Going into my third iteration, I decided I wanted something a bit more dynamic than just circles on a
                canvas (which kind of just look like bubbles). I set out to create a randomized "brush" to represent
                these readings. This iteration introduced "particles" which would roam the canvas with zero opacity
                until a data point above a set threshold would assign them to show at 10%. In response to class
                feedback, I gave each data set a different shape in addition to the color. Keyboard activity is
                represented by cyan rectangles and mouse activity, magenta ellipses.</p>
            <p>I limited the canvas to 1080x1080 rather than setting to window height and width. This would give me more
                consistent final pieces to represent together since I don't always have the browser window set to a
                fixed dimension when accessing the index.</p>
            <p>A lot of time was spent mapping and remapping the scales of the particles. Too little and the overall
                compositions were a bit uneventful. Too large and they consumed the canvas almost immediately. The more
                intense the vibrations, the higher the readout, the larger the particle. Simple enough! Once I figured
                out my scaling, I set out to measure the interactions over long periods of time.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>As shown, the compositions were unique and very telling. Like the previous bubbles sketches, there is a
                noticeable difference between the amount of keyboard and mouse activity on any given day, with some days
                more focused on the keyboard (like typing out this documentation) or days where there was far more mouse
                clicking (such as working on Motion Design 1 homework on After Effects). This was an entertaining study
                in how we can produce beautiful artwork by simply going about our business through the day.</p>
